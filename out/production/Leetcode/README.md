# 🚀 LeetCode Java Adventure 🐱‍💻

Welcome, brave soul, to my daily quest of becoming the ultimate Java-powered LeetCode Warrior! ⚔️☕️

## 🎯 Quest Objectives

- Crush 5-10 LeetCode problems daily (or at least valiantly try!).
- Level-up from a JavaScript front-end hero to a full-fledged Java ninja.
- Commit daily because GitHub’s green squares are my dopamine shots. 🌿💉

## 📂 Folder Map to Glory

- **`Basic Java/`** – From "What’s a semicolon?" to "I wrote a loop, and it actually worked!"
- **`Arrays/`** – Easy, Medium, Hard (a.k.a. the Holy Trinity of Coding Pain)
- **`Strings/`** – Reversals, Palindromes, and Pattern-Matching Wizardry
- **`Hashing/`** – Mastering Maps, Sets, and HashMap Witchcraft
- **`Two Pointers/`** – Because why use one pointer when you can have two?
- **`Sliding Window/`** – Speed-running subarrays like a pro
- **`Stacks & Queues/`** – The unsung heroes of time travel and undo operations
- **`Linked Lists/`** – Where pointers play mind games
- **`Trees/`** – Traversals, Heights, and Binary Brilliance
- **`Binary Search Trees/`** – Sorted Trees and Search Party Ops
- **`Heaps & Priority Queues/`** – Min-maxing like a true loot goblin
- **`Recursion/`** – Function-ception and stack overflow adventures
- **`Backtracking/`** – Trying everything until something sticks
- **`Dynamic Programming (DP)/`** – Memoization, Tabulation, and Brain Meltdowns
- **`Greedy/`** – Because who needs to think ahead?
- **`Bit Manipulation/`** – 0s and 1s doing dark magic
- **`Math & Number Theory/`** – GCD, Primes, Modular Arithmetic... the whole numeric buffet
- **`Graphs/`** – DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Union-Find, and other beautiful nightmares
- **`Tries/`** – The dictionary sorcery you didn’t know you needed
- **`Topological Sort/`** – Because order matters (sometimes)
- **`Segment Trees & Fenwick Trees/`** – Range Queries of Doom
- **`Design/`** – LRU Cache, Rate Limiters, and System Design Lite
- **`Concurrency/Multithreading/`** – When your code runs faster than your thoughts
- **`Miscellaneous/`** – Random epic boss battles mixing all topics

## 🗓️ Daily Ritual
1. Wake up.  
2. Brew Java ☕️, write Java 💻, dream in Java 🌙.  
3. Push my daily victories (and hilarious defeats) here.

## 🎖️ Goal
Turn interview anxiety into interview dominance—because whiteboards fear ME!

## 🔥 Let's GO!
The journey to coding greatness starts NOW! If you're here, leave a ⭐️ and join the epic adventure!

Happy coding! 🚀✨
